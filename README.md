# webNEZ

Copyright (C) 2018 Juergen Wothke

This is a JavaScript/WebAudio plugin of "NEZplug++" used to emulate music of various consoles: Famicom (.nes), 
Game Gear, Game Boy, MSX (.kss), ZX Spectrum (.ay), Hudson (.hes), etc. This plugin is designed to work with my generic WebAudio 
ScriptProcessor music player (see separate project). 

It supposedly emulates the following sound chips:

        Richo     NES-APU(RP2A03H)             [Famicom(NES)]
        Konami    VRC6(053328 VRC VI)          Castle vania 3, Madara, ...
        Konami    VRC7(053982 VRC VII)         Lagrange Point
        Nintendo  MMC5                         Just Breed, Yakuman Tengoku
        Richo     FDS(RP2C33A)                 Zelda(FDS), Dabada(FDS), ...
        Namco     NAMCOT106                    D.D.S.2, KingOfKings, ...
        Sunsoft   FME7                         Gimmick!

        Yamaha    FM-PAC(YM2413)               Aleste, Xak, ...
        Yamaha    MSX-AUDIO(Y8950)             Labyrinth, Xevious, ...

        Sega      GG-SNG                       [Game Gear]

        Richo     DMG-SYSTEM                   [Game Boy]

        Hudson    HES-PSG(HuC6280)             [PC-Engine(TG16)]

## Credits
The project is based on NEZplug++ 0.9.4.8 + 3 + 24.00: http://offgao.net/program/nezplug++.html

## Known limitations
There seems to be some bug in the re-initialization logic: A .KSS song that plays perfectly fine 
when played directly makes noises when played after *specific* types of other songs.
Test case: 1) "battlestar galactica theme.kss" - 2 channel MSX stuff 2) then 
"4th Unit 4 - Zero, The (MSX)(1990)(Data West).kss" - 1 channel MSX stuff 3) back to 1) that song
no longer works. It seems some leftover garbage from the previous song is not properly 
reinitialized when loading a new song in some corner of the emulation..


## Howto build

You'll need Emscripten (http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html). The make script 
is designed for use of emscripten version 1.37.29 (unless you want to create WebAssembly output, older versions might 
also still work).

The below instructions assume that the webNEZ project folder has been moved into the main emscripten 
installation folder (maybe not necessary) and that a command prompt has been opened within the 
project's "emscripten" sub-folder, and that the Emscripten environment vars have been previously 
set (run emsdk_env.bat).

The Web version is then built using the makeEmscripten.bat that can be found in this folder. The 
script will compile directly into the "emscripten/htdocs" example web folder, were it will create 
the backend_nez.js library. (To create a clean-build you have to delete any previously built libs in the 
'built' sub-folder!) The content of the "htdocs" can be tested by first copying it into some 
document folder of a web server. 


## Depencencies

The current version requires version 1.03 (older versions will not
support WebAssembly or may have problems skipping playlist entries) 
of my https://github.com/wothke/webaudio-player.

This project comes without any music files, so you'll also have to get your own and place them
in the htdocs/music folder (you can configure them in the 'songs' list in index.html).
